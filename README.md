Example playright project testing creating issues on a repository.

##Â What is this checking

1. Can setup an automation project with sensible configuration setup (.env)
2. Can handle authentication in a reusable way
3. Can write tests that interact with the page as a user would
4. Can write reusable actions
5. Has an intersting challenge where the same names button is on the page twice but one needs the selector narrowed to within a dialog
6. Has an interesting scenario where you need to wait for some confirmation text to appear before you can hit a button that is disabled until the confirmtion text appears

## Time to write

About 2 hours while watching TV ðŸ˜… used playwright as I hadn't used it in a little while.
